  <h1>A Lecture on Coding and Cupcakes</h1>
  <h2 class="intro">And Why No One Will Pay Me to Give It</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    I'm not even two minutes into this exercise and Virtual Studio shows at least 2 error codes. This would be less damaging to my image if I just pasted
    Lorem Ipsum into this paragraph like the assignment told me to do, but I'm in my 30's now and I finally realize that following the rules gets you nothing. 
    Much like breaking the rules...
  </p>
  <p class="intro"><strong>UPDATE:</strong>I think it's Visual Studio wiggin' out over the fact that I wrote 'css' but didn't add colons and semi-colons. I will investigate another day.</p>
  
  <h2>Advanced Practice</h2>
  <p class="try"> 
    Woah. I'm gonna try something sorta advanced for me. I'm gonna link to an image out of memory. Let's see if I can summon the picture of the cute penguin cupcake 
    from the other <a href="../cupcake-shop/popular-cupcakes.html">webpage</a>.

  <h2 class="done">I think that's it for now!</h2>
